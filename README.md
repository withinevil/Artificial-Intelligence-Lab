Q.No. 1		Max Marks : 15

Design a game  plays in a Rock, Paper, Scissors Tournament. In this tournament, the agent will play 1 game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against 100 unique opponents (for a total of 100 games). If you have never played Rock, Paper, Scissors before, the rules are below (taken from Wikipedia):
Rock-paper-scissors is a zero-sum hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
Apply Adversarial search algorithm and find optimal solution. Which move you would make as a maximizing player considering that your opponent also plays optimally? Comments the result


Q.No. 2		Max Marks: 5

A. Design a rational agent that runs on your cell phone and performs physical activity recognition using the data from the accelerometer on your cell phone. The physical activity recognition task identifies the physical activity you are performing at the current point in time as being from one of five physical activities: sitting, standing, walking, running or other. 
Design suitable agent in python, make agent class, and add functionality to it.

B . Suppose you have to travel Iqra University Gulshan campus 1 to Iqra University Main Campus. If the goal is IU Main campus, we need to know the
straight-line distances to IU Main Campus. Implement the given graph using, UCS (uniform cost search), A* search and find the optimal solution 
Give initial state, goal state, Successor function and path cost function (Implement it by using problem solving agent steps).
